                <h3>1. Product design</h3>

                <p class="about_text_desc">
                    Product designers use their creative prowess to research, design, and develop new products. The types of products they create depend on which industry they work in, but it could include everything from toys to tools to technology. These designers conduct market research to make sure their product will appeal to the target audience and won’t violate competitors’ copyrights. Then they’ll create early illustrations and prototypes of their designs before they’re sent into production.

Every aspect of branding design must align with these goals, as well as fit into the larger aesthetic of the company or organization. Consumers’ perception of a company is often driven by their branding, so graphic designers in this specialty put all their skills to work developing a visual brand that will connect with the target audience and project the right message about the company.
